<h2>Brennasoft Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><strong>Version 1.0</strong></p>

<p><strong>Effective on April 3, 2014</strong></p>

<p>This privacy statement describes how <strong>Brennasoft LLC.</strong> (Brennasoft) collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Brennasoft is in the business of selling applications. It is absolutely not in the business of selling personal information about our users.</p>

<p>We believe the best way to ensure your private information is protected is to make every effort to ensure we are never in possession of your private information in the first place.</p>

<h3>Collection and Use</h3>

<h4>We may collect the following personal information from you:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Usage activity about how you interact with our application(s) and which areas of our application(s) you visited.</li>
<li>Device Information and IP address.</li>
<li>Account information from your device.</li>
</ul>

<h4>We may use this information to:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Conduct research and analysis to improve our products.</li>
<li>Inform you about other Brennasoft products.</li>
<li>Inform you about policy changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe the best way for a product/service to keep your private data private is to avoid handling it altogether. We strive to do this whenever possible. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, applications by Brennasoft do not transfer any private or personal information from your device(s).</p>

<h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>

<p>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

<h4>We may disclose your personal information:</h4>

<ul>
<li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process.
*When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
<li>If Brennasoft is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
<li>To any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third party services</h3>

<p>Our applications make use of third party services for services such as application stability tracking and general application usage. While we make every effort to only use services provided by trustworthy and reputable third parties, we can accept no responsibility for how these third parties manage or share information and data in their possession.</p>

<h3>Third party links</h3>

<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

<h3>Tracking and Ads</h3>

<p>We, or a third party contracted by us, may use technologies to gather information about how you and others interact with our application(s). For example, we may aggregate how many users access a specific areas or features within our application. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our application is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you.</p>

<p>Ads appearing in any Brennasoft applications may be delivered to users by 3rd party advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers the behavior of applications/services written/managed by Brennasoft, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

<p>Brennasoft may collect statistics about the behavior of users of its products. Brennasoft may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Brennasoft does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described in this document.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
